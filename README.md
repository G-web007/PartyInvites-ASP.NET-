Setting the Scene
Imagine that a friend has decided to host a New Year’s Eve party and that she has asked me to create a web app that allows her invitees to electronically RSVP. She has asked for these four key features:
A home page that shows information about the party
A form that can be used to RSVP ("répondez s'il vous plaît" which means "please reply")
Validation for the RSVP form, which will display a thank-you page
A summary page that shows who is coming to the party
